Important Notes
---------------
0.31mm ring and 0.2mm drill via-in-pads must be resin filled with metal cap (IC1).

IC1 thermal pad vias must be resin filled with metal cap.

DRCs must be run on Gerber files before building boards.

All through hole vias may be plated shut.

Solder mask : dark blue, both sides, halogen free, glossy finish (NOT matte).

Silkscreen : white epoxy ink, halogen free, both sides. No silkscreen on pads.

Electrical test : 100 % netlist.

Boards are to be individually bagged.
